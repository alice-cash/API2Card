Some cards will not generate properly and will look funny. For example "Animate Objects" has an ascii table which you may need to manually format.
The generation scheme is only partially smart, it may push parts of a card to a Part 2 or Part 3 when some finagling would get it to fit on just 1 or 2 cards, such as on Banishment.
